# What is unit test

**Unit Testing** is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

# Why is Unit Testing Important?

Unit testing is a method that is used to test programs and applications to see if they function according to the clients’ specifications.

If any problems persist, they should ideally be taken care of earlier on so that they don’t show up when the final version is sent out to clients. Software unit testing mainly involves checking individual modules for errors.
